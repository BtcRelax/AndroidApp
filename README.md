# Asura

## What is this project for?

The goal of Asura is to make it easy to build an individual app which
parses a JSON File and display it in a ListView, mainly just with
configuring a single file.

## How do I get set up?

- 0. Import the project in Android Studio or use a editor.
- 1. Edit app/app/build.gradle
(applicationId, versionCode, versionName).
- 2. Change the application icon in app/app/src/main/res/drawable
(hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi).
- 3. Fill out online/plans.json and upload it somewhere (or push it to
GitHub).
- 4. Fill out app/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml .
- 5. Build the app with Android Studio or "gradle build".
